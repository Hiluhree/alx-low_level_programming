### Tasks
+ Task 0: [Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-variadic_functions/0-sum_them_all.c): A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

	+ Prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
	+ If n == 0, return 0
+ Task 1: [To be is to be the value of a variable](): Afunction that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

	+ Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
	+ where separator is the string to be printed between numbers
	+ and n is the number of integers passed to the function
	+ You are allowed to use printf
	+ If separator is NULL, donâ€™t print it
	+ Print a new line at the end of your function
