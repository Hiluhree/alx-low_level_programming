### Tasks
+ Task 0: [It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/0-whatsmyname.c): A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

	+ If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
	+ You should not remove the path before the name of the program
+ Task 1: [Silence is argument carried out by other means](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/1-args.c): A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

	+ Your program should print a number, followed by a new line
+ Task 2: [The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/2-args.c): A program that prints all arguments it receives.

	+ All arguments should be printed, including the first one
	+ Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
+ Task 3: [Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/3-mul.c): A program that multiplies two numbers.

	+ Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
	+ You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
	+ If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
+ Task 4: [To infinity and beyond](): A  program that adds positive numbers.

	+ Print the result, followed by a new line
	+ If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
	+ If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
	+ You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int
