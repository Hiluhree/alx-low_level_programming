## Tasks

+ Task 0: [putchar](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c): A program that prints putchar, followed by a new line.</br>

	+ The program should return 0
+ Task 1: [I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c): A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.</br>

	+ Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
	+ You can only use putchar twice in your code
+ Task 2: [10 x alphabet](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/2-print_alphabet_x10.c): A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.</br>

	+ Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
	+ You can only use putchar twice in your code
+ Task 3: [islower](): A Write a function that checks for lowercase character.</br>

	+ Prototype: int islower(int c);
	+ Returns 1 if c is lowercase
	+ Returns 0 otherwise
		- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.
