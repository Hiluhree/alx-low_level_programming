### Tasks
+ Task 0 : [98 Battery st.](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c): A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.</br>
	+ Prototype: void reset_to_98(int n);
+ Task 1: [Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c): A unction that swaps the values of two integers.
	+ Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
+ Task 2: [This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c): A function that returns the length of a string.

	+ Prototype: int strlen(char s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.
+ Task 3: [I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c): A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
	+ Prototype: void puts(char str);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
+ Task 4: [I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c): A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
	+ Prototype: void print_rev(char s);
+ Task 5: [A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c): A function that reverses a string.
	+ Prototype: void rev_string(char s);
+ Task 6 : [Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](): A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
	+ Prototype: void puts2(char str);
