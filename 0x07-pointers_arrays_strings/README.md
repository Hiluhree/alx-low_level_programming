## Tasks
+ Task 0: [memset](): Aa function that fills memory with a constant byte.

	+ Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
	+ The memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
	+ Returns a pointer to the memory area s
		- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
