## Tasks
+ Task 0: [memset](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/0-memset.c): A function that fills memory with a constant byte.

	+ Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
	+ The memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
	+ Returns a pointer to the memory area s
		- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
+ Task 1: [memcpy](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/1-memcpy.c): A function that copies memory area.

	+ Prototype: char memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
	+ The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
	+ Returns a pointer to dest
		- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memcpy. Run man memcpy to learn more.
+ Task 2: [strchr](): A function that locates a character in a string.

	+ Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
	+ Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
		- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strchr. Run man strchr to learn more.
